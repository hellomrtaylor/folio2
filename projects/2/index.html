  <h3 class="display_three ">The process</h3>
  <p class="article_body">What makes a great check in? Of course we had our own experience, but we needed to know what others thought. Together with my Product Manager we conducted guerilla research - asking people at a cafe about their check in experiences. We took the insights from this and ran a survey to Booking.com guests across the world, to verify the results at scale.</p>
  <p class="article_body">Armed with this research we ran a design sprint where a cross functional team of designers, product managers and researchers generated, challenged and iterated on concepts. We took these concepts and some early UI to remote usability testing with guests.</p>
  <p class="article_body">When our MVP was built, we beta tested with real guests at real hotels to get the feedback we needed to perfect the experience.</p>
